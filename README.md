- UPDATED: BigTreeModule class now supports passing in a table name for generic module classes.
- UPDATED: When creating module and adding its initial view, if the table has a "position" column it will be assumed Draggable instead of Searchable.

- UPDATED: BigTree::cURL now allows output to a file for less memory-intensive file downloads
- CHANGED: Field drawing and field processing now occurs in function scope with access to $admin, $bigtree, $cms, and $field. This limits the likelihood of one field type somehow breaking the main form's environment variables and also leads to much better code re-use.
- CHANGED: Field options for templates, settings, and callouts are no longer stored in the top level JSON object but are instead stored in the "options" object -- this allows field options to now include keys such as "title" and "subtitle" (though "type" is still restricted when used in a Callout).
- CHANGED: htmlMimeMail is no longer included in BigTree as it hadn't been updated in years. PHPMailer is now used as BigTree's default local mail sending tool.

- FIXED: Lots of general JavaScript clean-up
- BACKWARDS COMPATIBILTY: BigTree 4.1 packages that use the Array of Items field type for forms/templates/callouts/settings will need to have that field changed manually to a Matrix field after importing.
